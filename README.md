# Sequence visualizer

This program generates frame-by-frame visualization of sequences. It was originally developed for visualizing sequences of ship positions.

## Example

Example of one generated frame is shown below. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GertKanter/sequence_visualizer/develop/samples/three.json) is the JSON that was used to generate it (this is frame 9).
